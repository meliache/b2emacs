# b2emacs --- basf2 helper functions for EMACS


This package is intended for scientists in the Belle II collaboration that work
with the [Belle II Analysis Software Framework](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41781-018-0017-9) (basf2, currently still
collaboration-internal). It provides functions for getting help on basf2 modules
and basf2 variable from withing EMACS.

This package does not provide any IDE features for working with C++ or python.
For that, I recommend using other packages, e.g.
[elpy](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy) for python and
[lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode) for C++ editing. This package
only provides basf2-specific help that those packages are missing. See the
collaboration-internal https://confluence.desy.de/x/8wx6B for more tipps on
using EMACS with basf2.
